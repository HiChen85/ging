# ging
ging is a tool for create gin web framework development templates

This tool is for the freshmen who want to learn golang and gin web framework, it can easily create a gin dev template for you.
This project is also my first formal open-source project. I hope this can help those who are interested in Go programming language
to quickly build a template that helps them understand how a web application works with Go.

At present, there are still many parts of the project that have not been added to the template, and I will gradually improve it in the future.
If you think this tool is helpful, please give me a star. That is really important to me to maintain this project.

## How to use
Before you start to use this tool. I just imagine that you have installed the golang development environment on your device.
If you don't install it, you need to download and install it first.
